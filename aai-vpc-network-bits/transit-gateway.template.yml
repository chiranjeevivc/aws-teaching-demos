# 1.       If you still have last weekâ€™s architecture in your account, make sure you have broken the VPC Peering 
#     that was created as part of that challenge. If not, deploy 3 VPCs, each with 5 CIDRs in 3 distinct Regions with no peering.
#2.       Design the same globally distributed and logically separated network as last week, but this time do it using AWS Transit Gateway.
#3.       Extra step: Give the EC2 instances the ability to download patches from the Internet while still communicating using AWS Transit Gateway.
