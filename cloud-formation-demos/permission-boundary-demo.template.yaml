AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09

# This CloudFormation template demonstrates a permission boundary.
# The role "AverageDeveloperRole" will be assumable by users within the account.
# This role can do anything in IAM, like creating other roles, policies, etc.
# BUT anything they create will be subject to the permission boundary.

Parameters:
  UsePermissionBoundaries:
    Type: String
    AllowedValues: 
    - True
    - False
    Default: False
    Description: Do you want the roles to be setup with permission boundaries?  When false, the role we create will be able to exceed their own permissions.

  RequiredOwnerTag:
    Type: String
    Default: MyTeam
    Description: The value for the 'Owner' tag which must be present on all resources we create, modify, or delete.

  RolePrefix:
    Type: String
    Default: MyTeam
    Description: The first few letters of the role names that our principal will be allowed to create, update, and delete.

Conditions:
  PermissionBoundariesCondition:        !Equals [ !Ref UsePermissionBoundaries, True ]
